# Booking.com

In this project, I analyzed hotel data from booking.com (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mukuldeshantri/hotels-netherlands) for the Netherlands and developed a predictive model to help hotel managers optimize their pricing strategy. I first cleaned and preprocessed the data, including handling missing values, removing outliers, and feature engineering. Then, I performed exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset and visualize the patterns and trends. Based on the analysis, I identified the key factors that affect hotel prices, such as reviews , rating and city. Using these insights, I built a machine learning model using various regression techniques, including linear regression, decision trees, support vector machine, and random forests, to predict hotel prices. I evaluated the performance of the model using cross-validation, hyper-parameter tuning and various other metrics such as mean absolute error and R-squared. The results show that the model can predict hotel prices with high accuracy based on the data at hand, and could potentially be used by hotel managers to make data-driven pricing decisions. Overall, this project demonstrates my skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.
